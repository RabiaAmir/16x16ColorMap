# 16x16ColorMap

16x16 Color Map in Assembly Language:

This project demonstrates a 16x16 color map created using Assembly Language. It displays a grid of 16 rows and 16 columns, with each cell in the grid represented by a different color. The project makes use of DOS interrupts to control the video mode, cursor positioning, and color attributes. It serves as a practical example of low-level programming to manipulate text mode graphics and illustrates how Assembly Language can be used to interact directly with hardware.

Features:

* Displays all 16 possible colors in text mode

* Utilizes INT 10h interrupts for video control

* Demonstrates basic Assembly Language programming for character output and color manipulation
  
Ideal for students and enthusiasts looking to understand Assembly Language basics, video memory management, and low-level programming concepts.
